# Austin Weather Data Analysis and Visualization Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains the work related to the analysis and visualization of weather data for Austin, Texas. The project aims to explore and model weather patterns using historical weather data, with the goal of creating a predictive time series model and visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.

The project is divided into the following parts:  
Austin Weather EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
- This section includes a detailed exploratory analysis of the Austin weather dataset. The aim is to discover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, which will be used to guide the predictive modeling process.

Austin Weather Visualization (Predictive Model - Time Series):
- This part focuses on the creation and evaluation of a time series predictive model based on the weather data. Various visualization techniques are employed to illustrate the forecast and trends.

Data Visualization (Canva PDF):
- A comprehensive visualization of the data created using Canva to present insights in a more digestible, visually appealing format.

## Files in the Repository
Austin_Weather_EDA.ipynb:
- A Jupyter notebook that contains the exploratory data analysis of the Austin weather dataset. This notebook covers data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and initial visualizations.

Austin_Weather_Visualization.ipynb:
- This Jupyter notebook focuses on building and visualizing the time series model. It includes steps like data preparation for modeling, fitting models, and visualizing the predictions.
